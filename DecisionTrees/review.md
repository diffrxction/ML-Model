## Decision Trees
Learnt how to create decision trees and use them to make classifications. Here are some of the major takeaways:

    - Good decision trees have pure leaves. A leaf is pure if all of the data points in that class have the same label.
    - Decision trees are created using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes finding the feature that results in the largest information gain when splitting the data using that feature.
    - Creating an optimal decision tree is difficult. The greedy algorithm doesnâ€™t always find the globally optimal tree.
    - Decision trees often suffer from overfitting. Making the tree small by pruning helps to generalize the tree so it is more accurate on data in the real world.
